# Graphs
Experimenting with Graphs for my Computer Science Class

## About this Project

This project simply implements a graph data structure using Java. 
It includes methods for insertion and deletion of vertices and edges, as well as algorithms such as topological sorts and Dijkstra's algorithm.
The `Graph` class uses an adjacency map. This allows for efficient accesses while also avoiding the `O(|V|^2)` space complexity of an adjacency matrix.
The `Graph` class also use a generic type, so vertices can hold any `Comparable` object. Edges are weighted with `Integer` values.

I may update this project more over time.
